        "q": "What is 1RM?",
        "a": "1RM stands for One Rep Maximum - the maximum weight you can lift for a single repetition. It's used as a baseline to calculate your training loads."
      },
      "howSuggested": {
        "q": "How is the suggested load calculated?",
        "a": "For the first session of a cycle, the suggested load is 50% of your base 1RM. For subsequent sessions, it's your last session's load plus your weight increment setting, rounded to your rounding step."
      },
      "whyNoChange1RM": {
        "q": "Why can't I change my 1RM mid-cycle?",
        "a": "The base 1RM is fixed during a cycle to provide consistent progression. When you finish a cycle and start a new one, you can update your base 1RM based on your improved performance."
      },
      "whatStrength": {
        "q": "What does the Strength badge mean?",
        "a": "Sessions marked as 'Strength' are logged after finishing a cycle but before starting a new one. They follow the same progression but are tracked separately from Bilbo phase sessions."
      },
      "howSync": {
        "q": "How does cloud backup work?",
        "a": "When enabled, your data is automatically saved to Google Drive after each session. It uses a hidden app-specific folder that only this app can access. Your data is never shared."
      },
      "whatConflict": {
        "q": "What happens if there's a sync conflict?",
        "a": "If your local data differs from the cloud backup, you'll be asked to choose which version to keep. This can happen if you use the app on multiple devices."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "q": "Is my data private?",
        "a": "Yes. All data is stored locally in your browser. If you enable cloud backup, data is stored in your personal Google Drive account in a hidden folder. We don't have access to your data. Basic usage analytics may be collected but never includes personal workout details."
